 * The Bookmark API provides access to the storage for bookmarks managed by the browser-provider process.
 *
 * Major features :
 * - After getting the ID from bp_bookmark_adaptor_create(), other APIs use the ID as a parameter.
 * - Supports the callback that is called when other modules change any bookmarks.
 * - On success, @c 0 is returned. On error, @c -1 is returned, and the error code is set appropriately
